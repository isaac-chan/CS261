1) How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive push 
   operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array 
   will double in capacity each time new item is added to an already full dynamic array?
   As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what
   is the big-oh complexity for a push?
      
      56 Cost Units, O(1)+

2) How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive push
   operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will
   grow by a constant 2 spaces each time new item is added to an already full dynamic array?
   As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the
   big-oh complexity for a push?
      
      260 Cost Units, O(n)

3) Suppose that a dynamic array stack doubles its capacity when it is full, and shrinks
   (on Pop only) its capacity by half when the array is half full or less. Can you devise a
   sequence of N push() and pop() operations which will result in poor performance (O(N^2)
   total cost)? How might you adjust the array's shrinking policy to avoid this? (Hint: You
   may assume that the initial capacity of the array is N/2.)

      Keep pushing values to the stack until I reach capacity, which makes the capacity double. 
      Then I pop a value from the stack, which makes the size drop below half the capacity,
      so the capacity is cut in half.
      I can avoid this by changing the array's shrinking policy to shrink capacity by half
      when the array is 1/4 full or less.
